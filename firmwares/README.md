## Notice
While it would certainly be nice to have one firmware that supports all the features of the watch, I haven't had the time yet to write that. Technically it is absolutely possible, since the watch has a 32Mbit flash chip which is certainly more than enough for all of the different firmwares here. Also, I haven't published a firmware yet that uses all of the power-saving features of the ESP8266. `wifitime` uses light sleep mode and wakes up every 1 second to update the screen, which makes the battery last for about 1 day. With deep sleep and less frequent updates, battery life can easily reach 2 days.
